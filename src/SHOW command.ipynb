    "\n",
    "**`SHOW`** â€” show the value of a run-time parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synopsis\n",
    "```\n",
    "SHOW name\n",
    "SHOW ALL\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "**`SHOW`** will display the current setting of run-time parameters. These variables can be set using the **`SET`** statement, by editing the `postgresql.conf` configuration file, through the `PGOPTIONS` environmental variable (when using libpq or a libpq-based application), or through command-line flags when starting the postgres server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "* **_name_** - The name of a run-time parameter. Available parameters are documented in Chapter 20 and on the SET reference page. In addition, there are a few parameters that can be shown but not set:\n",
    "    * `SERVER_VERSION` - Shows the server's version number.\n",
    "    * `SERVER_ENCODING` - Shows the server-side character set encoding. At present, this parameter can be shown but not set, because the encoding is determined at database creation time.\n",
    "    *  `LC_COLLATE` - Shows the database's locale setting for collation (text ordering). At present, this parameter can be shown but not set, because the setting is determined at database creation time.\n",
    "    * `LC_CTYPE` - Shows the database's locale setting for character classification. At present, this parameter can be shown but not set, because the setting is determined at database creation time.\n",
    "    * `IS_SUPERUSER` - True if the current role has superuser privileges.\n",
    "* **`ALL`** - Show the values of all configuration parameters, with descriptions."
